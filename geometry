my weak topic.

question : 
very basic

problem link :
https://codeforces.com/contest/1216/problem/C

my thoughts :
2 black sheets -> either they will intersect of they will be sharing one corner .
if they are not doing so then their distane will be at least one.
so the point which is not covered will be x.5 something .
so we multiply 2 to every vertex and we are only going to check interger cordinates.

key::
now assume all possible ways to cover white sheet we will find out that if it's not totally covered then at least one cordinate (boundary)
will be  out of both the black boxes.
