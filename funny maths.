my Thoughts :
at 1st glance it's seems to be a scary question.
but it isn't.
the given function is ignoring the -ve cur_sum. this is the key to solve the problem.
if we put -1 as a0  the the algo will give answer (s+1)*(n-1) . where s is the sum over all the elements.
but our valid answer can be n*s .
we consider this as our answer.
so we have to somehow manages to make diff of this 2 values equal to k.
 k = s - n + 1.
 if we take max value of n the n is 2000. -1 (rest sequence.)
 reset sequence is having sum = (s+1).
 s + 1 = k + n.
 2000 + k.
 element can't exceed 1e6 so we greedily fill this value(2000+k) at every position.
if greater than 1e6 then print 1e6 other wise print k.
and after that fill 0 if any place is remaining.
