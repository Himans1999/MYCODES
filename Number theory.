Thoughts : 
n = 4 , (2 , 2)  -> 2 divisors and both are same.
we can say it is totally periodic max col can be used is 2.
n = 6 , (2 , 3) -> period 2 and period 3 will create a conflict.  
if 2 different primes divides the same value then only 1 colour is possible. 
if a number is prime -> answer will be n only.
