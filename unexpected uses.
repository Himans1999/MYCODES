Linked List.

it's very rare that someone use Linked List in cp.
but sometimes it's very fast.
although pointers makes it slow.
but still in one question i thought to implement this .

Thoughts :
just binary search the answer.
and just check if it is possible to make a subsequence of length greater than or equal to k having answer less than or equal to x.(BS)

Thoughts -> a[i-1] a[i] a[i+1]

if we want to include a[i] in current sequence : 
- if a[i-1] and a[i+1] will be included in future then ans = 0 (contrediction.)
- if a[i-1] and a[i+1] will not be included -> then we have 2 possiblilty of removal and both are indistinguisable -> beacause after including element a[i] -> a[i] will become 
  removable.
  ans = ans * 2 -> the continue;
- if only 1 of them is removable then removal that and continue.
